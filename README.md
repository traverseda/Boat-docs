Documentation for my boat, the "Shenanagins". Only tracking stuff I've had to actually deal with myself.
As such it's always going to be pretty incomplete.

**NOTES**  
S&amp;S; design #1235.  
Originally promoted as the NEW HORIZONS 25.  
This was S&amp;S;'s first production sailboat designed as an ALL fiberglass
small cruiser.  
Ray Green, a pioneer in the field, as the builder, made a perfect fit.  
Many of the components for the interior, etc, were molded fiberglass, a
practice that did not become common for a number of years to come.
